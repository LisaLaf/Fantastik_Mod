  "book.fantastikmod.note2.page1": "Recently a trader came and sold dragon fur for 20 EMERALDS... A really rare thing... But the price... It seems easier to go to the snows to search for it yourself than to buy enough for good armor.",
  "book.fantastikmod.note3.page1": "Kitsune... Extremely unusual foxes. They talk and even protect from monsters... I wonder where they came from? I heard from one traveler about some goddess, Inari I think she was called. They said it was she who sent the kitsune into the world. How true is this?",

  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.about_place": "This place was born from a shard of the moon. Once, Hati bit off a piece of the luminary shining with blue light, it fell to the earth and gave birth to this forest filled with the powers of the moon",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.who_haiti": "Hati is one of two brothers who pursues the moon every night, wanting to devour it",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.about_brothers": "Two brothers - Hati and Skoll. One chases the moon, the other - the sun. Both thirst to consume the luminaries",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.if_eat_moon": "If he eats the moon... something terrible will happen. But I, as a spirit confined to this place, cannot know all the secrets of the universe. You should ask him yourself.",

  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.ask_join": "Follow you? I cannot exist far from this forest. The lunar magic that flows in these lands gives me life",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.how_to_tame": "If you had an amulet created from a piece of the forest... Then I could follow you and a part of the forest would always be with me",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.farewell": "May the moonlight protect you on your path...",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.where_haiti": "He hasn't been seen for a long time... But before, he spent his days in this forest, sleeping in caves while the sun was shining. Now though... Perhaps he hides in the darkest corners of this world",
  "dialog.moon_deer.greeting": "Did you want to ask something, traveler?",
  "dialog.moon_deer.outside_world": "The world beyond the forest... It's unusual. So many new things. Probably, as humans would say - curious.",
  "dialog.moon_deer.feelings": "I feel... If measured by human standards, then normal? Everything is fine, thank you for asking.",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.is_dangerous": "He never touched us spirits... But you, humans... Rarely does anyone enter the forest, and even more rarely does someone find Hati... Perhaps you're right and he might be dangerous.",
  "dialog.wild_moon_deer.how_know": "Beyond the forest there must be those who know. Those same ones told us and the winds part of the legend...",
  "dialog.kitsune.greeting": "Did you want to ask something?",

  "dialog.kitsune.personal1": "Once I was an ordinary fox and one day I was granted special powers... Hee-hee, just kidding. I just grew up and learned",
  "dialog.kitsune.personal2": "You know, every kitsune has the opportunity to grow a new tail? To do this, she must be strong or live another hundred years",
  "dialog.kitsune.personal3": "We kitsune love to play with travelers. Sometimes we take the form of beautiful women, sometimes old men. But with you I decided to be myself - that's much more interesting!",
  "dialog.kitsune.personal4": "My favorite pastime is teasing overconfident samurai. Once I made a whole squad search for a non-existent treasure for three days! And then they were looking for their katanas because all this time they were walking with ordinary sticks! Hee-hee!",
  "dialog.kitsune.personal5": "Tofu... Mmm... I remember the first time I tried it. It was in a small village at the foot of the mountain. Since then it's been my weakness!",
  "dialog.kitsune.personal6": "We kitsune live very long lives. I've seen how the seasons change, how people are born and return to the earth at sunset of life...",

  "dialog.kitsune.story1_response": "Maybe. Or maybe not. That's a little secret",
  "dialog.kitsune.story2_response": "The longest living kitsune have 9 tails. Someday I'll have that many too!",
  "dialog.kitsune.story3_response": "I can! Don't doubt my skills! Or next time in the village you'll have to be more careful when trading with the locals",
  "dialog.kitsune.story4_response": "Yes! I clouded their minds a bit and they thought the sticks were their katanas! Too bad no one met them on the way, it would have been funny to watch them fight with that",
  "dialog.kitsune.story5_response": "You're the ordinary one! I don't tell you that your diamonds are ordinary glass, do I? I have my values, you have yours",
  "dialog.kitsune.story6_response": "Me? And sad? Of course not! But... Be careful on your journey and come back",

  "dialog.kitsune.legend1": "They say that a nine-tailed kitsune has such power that she could turn into a second moon, illuminating the night with her silvery light when the real moon hid behind the clouds.",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend2": "According to ancient legends, kitsune serve the goddess of fertility and prosperity Inari. They guard shrines and punish those who steal rice or desecrate temples.",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend3": "Legend has it that kitsune can create illusions of entire cities. Travelers caught in such illusions can wander for days without realizing that everything around is just magic.",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend4": "Old stories tell of kitsune who fell in love with mortals. But such unions rarely ended happily - because people age, while kitsune live for centuries.",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend5": "They say that kitsune keep special pearls. Maybe you've already encountered such from wandering merchants or in the grass?",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend6": "According to legend, the wisest kitsune can predict the future. But they rarely share their predictions, for knowledge of the future can change destiny.",

  "dialog.kitsune.legend1_response": "When I grow 8 more tails, then I'll be able to",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend2_response": "That, my friend, is a secret",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend3_response": "That's why you shouldn't anger a kitsune!",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend4_response": "No, I'm fine alone",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend4_followup": "You feed me tofu, why not?",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend5_response": "Maybe you've already encountered such from wandering merchants or in the grass?",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend6_response": "I predict... That right now you'll give me lots of tofu!",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend6_serious": "But seriously, you can't know the future. And that's a legend. Legends aren't always true. Or maybe I can... Hee-hee. Someday the secret will be revealed",
  "dialog.kitsune.legend6_silent": "You won't give... Yes... This time my predictive skills failed me...",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.greeting": "Greetings traveler, did you want to ask something?",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.who_are_you": "I'm a kitsune, maybe you've already heard about us",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.can_talk": "Of course I can! Or did you think I was an ordinary fox?",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.activities": "Doing something. Walking, wandering here and there. Attacking monsters... The usual routine",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.ask_monsters": "Yes, and are you going to doubt my abilities? You know, I could set you on fire for testing. Want to?",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.test_fire": "There! Next time think before you speak. Unless you want my threats to be more than just words",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.no_thanks": "Thanks... Better not",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.ask_follow": "Follow? With you? Where and why? I'm fine here actually",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.why_follow": "Still, why would I need that? Although... If you provide me with tofu for all the time I'm with you, then I might as well go with you on your travels.",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.tofu_serious": "Well, it's rarely found around here, and I really love it... Hmm... Everyone has their own values, understand?",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.how_much_tofu": "A lot! Preferably a hundred, but I'll make a discount... Let me think... Well, from 20+ tofu I'll consider your offer",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.too_much": "Hey! I actually gave you a discount! And not a small one! That's the final price!",
  "dialog.wild_kitsune.ok_bring": "I'll be waiting for that",
